- Dependency Injection (DI) in C#
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows classes to receive their dependencies rather than creating them. It promotes decoupling and improves testability by enabling the swapping 
of dependencies with ease. There are three types of Dependency Injection: constructor injection, property injection, and method injection. Let’s explore each one briefly.

1. Constructor Injection: 
Dependencies are passed to a class through its constructor. This ensures that the class has all required dependencies to function correctly from the moment of instantiation.

2. Property Injection: 
Dependencies are set through public properties of a class. This allows for optional dependencies and supports lazy initialization.

3. Method Injection:
Dependencies are passed to a method when it is called. This is useful when a method requires certain dependencies for specific operations.
